    "text": "1 Introduction\nAfter launching its initial fleet of 6,000 bikes across 300 stations in 2013, Citi Bike has since transformed the streets of New York City in many lasting ways. Today, Citi Bike is the largest bike share system in the United States, approaching 30,000 bikes and 2,000 stations across New York City, Jersey City, and Hoboken, New Jersey. \nWith around 3.7 million rides in October 2023, ridership is up approximately 30% compared to the same time last year and almost 75% compared to pre-pandemic levels in October 2019. As ridership demand and growth continue to reach new highs, Citi Bike and New York City are responding by introducing plans for expansions and improvements to the system. On November 3, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams and New York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriques announced plans to significantly expand Citi Bike services by the end of next year. These plans include doubling the number of electric bikes at its stations and electrifying 20% of its existing stations.\nThis year the city is celebrating 10 years of the bike-sharing program that changed New York City's transportation landscape, infrastructure, culture, and accessibility. As Citi Bike continues to establish itself as an indispensable service and vital component of the city's transportation network, ensuring its reliability and equity is key to securing the program's success in the long run. This project will examine Citi Bike's growth throughout the years, exploring demand, ridership growth, station expansions, bike availability, trip distance and duration, and membership costs, and try to identify notable trends across these variables. \n\nSome specific questions we are interested in include:\n\nHow has Citi Bike ridership grown since launch?\nHow did Citi Bike approach station expansion over the years? (when and where did they expand to, different phases of expansion)\nHow does ridership differ across neighborhoods in New York?\nHow does station \"usability\"/ availability differ across neighborhoods?\nWhat does the demographic of Citi Bike riders look like? Who are the primary riders? \nHow do ridership and demand differ across different payment plans/membership types?"

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nData Sources and Collection\nOur project primarily utilizes data from Citi Bike New York’s bike sharing system. The data, accessible via Citi Bike’s system data and its Live API, encompasses a comprehensive record of bike usage. We have collected all available data from the year 2013 to the present, amassing over 64 GB of raw data, downloading from their bulk data website, and process it in batches and merging various batches into bigger ones due to computational power constraints.\n\nData Collection Method and Responsible Entity:\n\nCiti Bike, operated by NYC Bike Share LLC, a subsidiary of Lyft Inc, collects the data​​.\nThe data collection method isn’t specified in their monthly analysis reports, however it likely obtained through the combination of Citi-Bike app (through Customer Usage) with GPS input embedded on the app, bike and dock tracking sensors each station has. The data includes real-time program data, ensuring current and relevant information​​.\nAPI data showing current station capacities and status are updated every 5 seconds, while their bulk data showing bike transactions every first day of the month for the past month.\n\nData Processing and Format\nTo facilitate our analysis, we developed a custom data processing tool that converts raw data into a structured format suitable for time-series analysis. This process involved tracking hourly inflow and outflow at each of Citi Bike’s 2500+ stations. Our final data-set consists of monthly data frames, each representing around 720 hours (24 hours x 30 days) across all 2500 stations, thus offering a detailed view of bike station usage over time, and we have collected data for 130 months. The data is structured with time (dates for each hour since 2013 until end of October 2023) on the rows and station names on the columns, with each cell indicating the inflow at a specific station and time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive API Integration\nAdditionally, we are leveraging the Live API to monitor real-time station capacities and bike availability, which provides valuable insights into current usage patterns and station dynamics.\nKnown Data Issues\nOne of the challenges we’ve encountered is ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the historical data, particularly in the context of station additions, removals, and capacity changes over time. These factors can significantly impact time-series analysis and trend interpretation. We have only kept columns (stations names) that were consistent over the time-frame of our analysis.\nData Importation\nData importation is performed through automated scripts that fetch and process data from both the static data-sets and the Live API, ensuring consistent and up-to-date information flow into our analysis pipeline."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nLinking Data to Research Questions\nOur research seeks to uncover and visualize trends in bike-sharing usage across various regions and stations in New York City over time. The structured time-series data enables us to conduct comprehensive analyses, such as identifying peak usage times, understanding seasonal variations, and detecting long-term usage trends.\nUtilizing Visualizations\nThe attached visualization exemplifies our approach. It displays the average hourly inflow traffic frequency at Citi Bike stations since 2013, offering insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of bike usage in New York City. We would like to dig into these patterns and explore how the frequency of usage got affected by time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing Live Data\nIncorporating real-time data from the Live API allows us to extend our analysis to current usage patterns, further enriching our understanding of the system’s dynamics and assisting in predictive modeling for future trends.\nThis data-driven approach provides a robust foundation for answering our core research questions about the usage patterns of New York City’s bike-sharing system and contributes to a deeper understanding of urban mobility."

    "section": "2.3 Missing Value Analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing Value Analysis\nIn our analysis of the Ci-ti Bike data, we focus on the transformation of raw transaction data into a more aggregated and analyzable format. Each transaction in the dataset represents a discrete bike usage event, with details such as time, location, and duration. To construct a meaningful analysis framework, we aggregate these individual transactions into hourly inflow counts for each station.\nCharacteristics of Raw Data:\n\nThe raw data is transactional, with each entry representing a distinct bike usage event.\nThis dataset does not contain any ‘NA’ values, indicating a comprehensive record of all transactions recorded by the system.\n\nTransformation Process:\n\nWe process this data by summing and filtering transactions to attain an hourly inflow count per station.\nThis aggregation smoothens the data for time-series analysis, focusing on broader usage trends rather than individual transactions.\n\nChallenges in Missing Data Identification:\n\nA critical limitation of this approach is the inability to distinguish between a non-recorded transaction and a genuine absence of transactions. If a bike is used but the transaction is not recorded due to any system error, it is indistinguishable from a time frame where no bike usage occurred.\nConsequently, as data analysts, we cannot definitively assert whether a gap in the data is due to a recording failure or actual inactivity.\n\nObservations of Missing Data:\n\nUpon reducing the transaction data from a per-second basis to an hourly format, we observed gaps in the data, where certain dates appear to be skipped.\nThese missing values could represent days with extremely low or no activity at specific stations, or they might indicate periods where data was not recorded or collected due to technical issues.\n\n\nAlthough there is no documented explanation for the clusters of missing data, our team has hypothesized potential reasons for these gaps, though no clear pattern of missing data is evident.\n\nRegion 1 (as shown in the image below) aligns with the lock-down period in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly through the summer months. This period likely is missing due to bike usage restrictions due to public health restrictions and changes in commuting patterns, potentially resulting in sparse data during this period.\nRegion 2, while not technically missing data, represents a period where data is unavailable due to its coincidence with the “leap day” in February, which occurs every four years. This absence is likely a result of the dataset’s structure, which may not account for this quadrennial variation in the calendar.\nRegion 3 presents a more elusive case. Our research has not uncovered a formal explanation for this data gap. However, the fact that these missing data points consistently occur during winter months leads us to speculate that it might be related to seasonal factors. The hypothesis is that this period could correspond to times when Citi Bike operations are impacted by heavy snow or routine maintenance closures, leading to reduced activity or data recording."
